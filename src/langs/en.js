  aboutDavid: {
    Text2: 'Since then he has been working with this relationship and refining his sensitivity and skills. His abilities have given him the opportunity to travel, presenting classes and workshops in many countries of Europe as well as Turkey and Israel. <br>  Ten years ago he began to investigate the connection between resonant frequencies of the human body and health and well being. The result is the culmination of his life’s work - The Resosense Personal Practice System a simple personal practice that develops both the physical and energetic aspects of being. "I had been suffering from the effect of Lyme Disease (Boreliosis) for serveral years. My activity was extremely limited. In the process of developing Resosense, I noticed my body returning to normal. I was able to resume most of my normal activities. That got me very excited.  But what really excites me is being able to empower other people by teaching this simple technique that, with regular practice, can create profound changes in almost any aspect of their life.” ',
    Text1: 'Since he was a child, David has been connecting into other possibilities. Reading about ESP, yogis, as well as "listening to the universe" were not most common of childhood pastimes. At the age of 12, sailing through the Pacific for a year with his family, only deepened his connection with himself and nature. Focusing on the body’s innate ability to heal, he became a Doctor of Chiropractic in 1995 and then moved to the island of Mallorca where he still lives with his wife and two daughters. A chance encounter with N.S.A. (Network Spinal Analysis) twenty years ago started him on a path of discovery into the energetic nature of the body/mind.',
